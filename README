Encrypts data in a db. Encrypted fields should be binary type.

Usage:
    var $actsAs = array(
        'Encryptable' => array(
            'fields' => array(
                'EncyrptedModel' => array(
                    'encrypted_field'
                )
            )
        )
    );

TODO - Recursing through associated models should be better.
